# Exchange Design
2-of-3 multi-signature trustless escrow: buyer commits money into a 2-of-3 address with the seller
and a third-party arbitrator. If transaction goes smoothly, then both buyer and
seller sign the transaction to forward the money to the seller. If something goes wrong,
they can sign a transaction to refund the buyer. If they cannot agree, they both appeal
to the third-party who will arbitrate and provide a second signature to the party that
it deems deserves it. The arbitrator cannot steal the money as they have only one key.
